<p>
This pages shows a randomly generated chart of the price of a fictitious stock.
The aim is to illustrate that even a totally random graph can display features that may be mistaken for trends (which in the field of technical analysis may be called things like support, resistance and channels).

<div><canvas id="chartCanvas"></canvas></div>
<p>The graph is generated with a simple algorithm. In essence:</p>
<p><i>next value = current value * R()</i></p>
<p>where <i>R</i> is a function that generates a random number, distributed around 1.0 with a standard deviation of approximately 3%.</p>
<p>See <i>generateGraph()</i> in <a href="https://github.com/foolo/RandomCourseGraph/blob/master/rcg.js">rcg.js</a> for the exact implementation details.</p>
